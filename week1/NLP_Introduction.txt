1. NLP levels:

Phonetic/Phonological Analysis(speech)		OCR/Tokenization(text)

Morphological Analysis --> Syntactic analysis --> Semantic Interpretation --> Discourse Processing


2. Deep Learning

Numerical Optimization

Representation learning attempts to automatically learn good features or representations

Deep learning algorithms attempt to learn (multiple levels of) representation and an output


3. Content

key methods: RNN and attention etc.

NLP chanlleges:
(1) complexity in representing, learning and using
	linguistic/situational/world/visual knowledge

(2) Human languages are ambiguous(unlike programing 
and other formal languages)

(3) Human language interpretation depends on real 
world, common sense, and contextual knowledge
