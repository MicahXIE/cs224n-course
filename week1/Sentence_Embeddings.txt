Word -> Sentence

compute sentence similairtiy using the inner product
use as features for sentence classification (e.g sentiment analysis)

Bag-of-words (BOW)
v("NLP") = 1/3(v("natural") + v("language") + v("processing"))
Recurrent neural networks, recursive neural networks, convolutional neural networks

Paper method (unsupervised):
weighted Bag-of-words + remove some special direction

Step 1: each word has a seperate weight
Step 2: compute the first principal components (PCA)
